1.837,10.055,SPEAKER_00," All right, hi everybody. My name is Daniel Garner Quintero. I am one of the licensed mental health counselors at Counseling and Psychological Services here at UCF.",8.218
10.055,19.454,SPEAKER_00, Today I am joined by a fellow student here on campus who is agreed to play a client. We're going to be doing a mock session.,9.399000000000001
19.454,30.44,SPEAKER_00, The purpose of this recording is to try to show kind of what a telehealth appointment looks like. Most of our services are going to be based in telehealth through,10.986
30.44,44.497,SPEAKER_00," the foreseeable future, and we understand that that creates a barrier for some people. It can feel intimidating, it can feel uncomfortable, and we prefer the in-person. So we were hoping that this would be an opportunity to kind of dispel any anxiety around that.",14.056999999999999
44.497,52.58,SPEAKER_00," So I'm going to allow Prita to introduce herself, and then we're going to dive right into our little mock session. Again, it's important to note that we are",8.082999999999998
52.58,61.456,SPEAKER_00, acting this out. This is not a real session. We are not using real information or facts based on anybody's life.,8.876000000000005
61.456,76.34,SPEAKER_00," I would also discourage anybody from using any of the interventions you see employed here in your own life without consulting with a mental health professional. Okay. Thanks, Daniel. I'm Pritha Ambu and I'm a rising senior at UCF.",14.884
76.829,87.258,SPEAKER_01," And I'm a peer educator at CAPS here, and I thought this would be a cool opportunity to help out CAPS. Yeah, and we're very thankful for it. So thank you, Brita. Thank you.",10.429000000000002
87.595,99.61,SPEAKER_00," All right, so we're going to go ahead and dive right in. So Preetha, welcome back. It's been about two weeks since we were last together. I did take a look at some of the scores you filled out on your CCAPs. Thank you for doing that prior to session. And it looks",12.015
99.61,113.178,SPEAKER_00, like they've improved a little bit. So I'm excited to kind of see what's been going on. And I want to check in on your homework. So do you want to start with kind of what's been going on over the last two weeks? Or do you want to start with the homework and the square breathing that I suggested?,13.567999999999998
113.667,128.416,SPEAKER_01," Um, so nothing much has changed in terms of what's been happening in my life in the past two weeks, besides like the same school worrying about COVID and what's happening in terms of like my next year of college and graduating.",14.748999999999995
128.652,141.764,SPEAKER_01," But as for the homework. I felt that sometimes it would work, but there were times when my anxiety would just be like through the roof and like my thoughts are racing and I just couldn't control my thoughts.",13.112000000000023
142.287,153.982,SPEAKER_01," and my thoughts were like controlling me. So I felt like the square breathing wasn't really helping those issues. Yeah. Okay. So what I'm hearing then is one, things haven't really changed, right? Which is very true. There's a lot of.",11.694999999999993
153.982,162.942,SPEAKER_00," the same thing going on every day, right? Right now with us all trying to kind of stay closer to home and kind of try to",8.960000000000008
162.942,171.802,SPEAKER_00, practice social distancing and stuff like that. So I think that that's understandable that there haven't been any kind of major transitions or changes.,8.859999999999985
172.139,185.96,SPEAKER_00," And it sounds like maybe the square breathing was mildly, moderately successful. There were times where at lower levels, moderate levels of anxiety, we were able to maybe slow that down and dial that back a little bit.",13.820999999999998
185.96,191.495,SPEAKER_00, but in really peak times that wasn't as helpful. Yeah.,5.534999999999997
191.933,203.763,SPEAKER_00," I think that's understandable, right? When our anxiety gets too high, it almost kind of takes on a life of its own and begins to override some of our normal and natural defenses.",11.830000000000013
203.763,217.921,SPEAKER_00," as our body is scrambling to figure out why it feels so fearful, but it can identify something dangerous in that moment. So I think that that's really normal. As I said during our first session, what I like to do is I like to not",14.157999999999987
218.208,231.421,SPEAKER_00," encourage too many new things at once because I think it can almost be overwhelming in its own way, okay? So even though it can feel a little frustrating or defeating to see that that skill didn't work for every situation, right?",13.212999999999994
231.556,244.398,SPEAKER_00," We're going to slowly build tools into your toolbox, right? And tools are all meant for a specific thing, right? If I gave you a hammer, right, but you needed a screwdriver, then yeah, it's not going to be as successful, right?",12.841999999999985
244.398,252.177,SPEAKER_00," So we've got a hammer, the hammer worked with the nails, but it sounds like we might need some other tools, which again, makes sense, right?",7.778999999999996
252.177,265.475,SPEAKER_00," So why don't we work on one, exploring some of those situations where it wasn't as helpful to maybe understand and gain a little insight into the anxiety you're feeling in that moment, right? And",13.29800000000003
265.762,280.409,SPEAKER_00," From there, I'll try to make some recommendations that might be helpful to, again, add more tools into your toolbox. Does that sound good? Yeah. Okay, great. So talk to me about those times where it sounds like it got a little scary and a little overwhelming. What was going on?",14.646999999999991
281.708,295.664,SPEAKER_01," So whenever I felt like my anxiety was through the roof, it would just be when times when I felt like there were so many external factors all piling up at the same time, whether it be emails streaming in about the new changes to campus plans.",13.95599999999996
296.086,308.995,SPEAKER_01," Like emails from my college about my GPA, from friends about worrying about COVID and its changes and all those factors just like all piling at once and it starts to accumulate.",12.908999999999992
309.535,323.339,SPEAKER_00," And it just like builds up so I can't even control it. Yeah. It sounds like it's almost too much information at one time kind of coming at you. Um, and it's overwhelming. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",13.803999999999974
323.761,337.717,SPEAKER_00," What's it like for you as you start to kind of become flooded with all of that information? Can you describe that for me a little bit more? Yeah, so at the beginning I'll try to kind of",13.95599999999996
338.273,352.955,SPEAKER_01," distract myself from like the initial thing that starts to come in, like the new information. But sometimes I just feel like I also get anxious to like know what they're saying so that I can plan for it. And then so I like",14.68199999999996
353.393,364.092,SPEAKER_01, tempted to like check whatever all the media like all social media all emails everything just because I don't I want to make sure that I can plan for it but then in turn like I just feel like my heart's also like,10.699000000000012
364.497,372.158,SPEAKER_01, racing. My thoughts are keep racing with everything that's new that's coming in. So I feel like I'm giving into it.,7.661000000000001
372.58,384.781,SPEAKER_00," But I can't help it. Yeah, it almost sounds like it's a little defeating. And I want to normalize that for you, right? Not the defeating part. I think that's probably normal, too, when we find that we're struggling with something.",12.201000000000022
384.781,395.429,SPEAKER_00, But I think the desire to kind of check and recheck right to find out all the information right there's so many unknowns and so much that's outside of our control right now.,10.647999999999968
395.429,409.908,SPEAKER_00," that worry, right, and can give us a false sense of control. It can feel like we're doing something productive. And then it kind of, like I said before, it begins to take on a life of its own and almost begins to snowball.",14.479000000000042
409.908,424.825,SPEAKER_00," Right? And that snowballs when we find ourselves suddenly very overwhelmed. And unfortunately, all of this is happening in parts of our brain that are super important, super vital, and everything they're feeling is very important.",14.916999999999973
424.825,435.811,SPEAKER_00, But they're not very good at things like planning and creativity and problem solving. Right. So what I want to suggest is something designed to,10.98599999999999
436.722,449.952,SPEAKER_00," allow you to kind of control the worry a little bit, right? We can't control the planning or the changes or the virus or the testing or the numbers or how our leaders choose to respond. We can't control those things, right?",13.230000000000018
449.952,459.689,SPEAKER_00," But what I'd like to do is see if we can't give you a little control over how and when you're worrying. How does that sound? Yeah, that sounds like I could really use that.",9.737000000000023
459.942,466.608,SPEAKER_00," Okay, yeah. Again, I think what you're feeling is really normal and natural, so I don't feel like we need to say like,",6.665999999999997
467.654,477.29,SPEAKER_00," bad prete, you're not allowed to feel that. I'd rather just give you some tools so that you can have a little bit more say about when and how it's happening, okay?",9.636000000000024
477.442,491.971,SPEAKER_00," So what I'm going to suggest, and I will at the end of our session today, I'll actually share with you a file through OneDrive so that you have kind of these written instructions and you don't have to remember everything I'm saying. So if you want to take notes, that's a good idea.",14.528999999999996
492.916,507.378,SPEAKER_00," But what I'm going to suggest is a skill called worry appointments, okay? Worry appointments kind of operate with the assumption that we can't control how we feel. I cannot control the worry. I cannot control the anxiety, right?",14.461999999999989
507.378,521.755,SPEAKER_00," All of that's happening in the kind of the deep, dark recesses of my mind, right? And what's happened is my brain has detected something that's scary or something that's making me feel out of control. And its response to that is to try to reestablish.",14.37700000000001
521.755,530.328,SPEAKER_00," some sense of safety, right? And because it's not able to do that, it just kind of spins up, right? Again, all normal, all very natural.",8.572999999999979
530.328,538.31,SPEAKER_00," So worry appointments say, okay, that's going to happen, so I can't stop that. But maybe, just maybe, I can control when and how I do that.",7.981999999999971
538.31,551.506,SPEAKER_00," Right? And so what I'm going to encourage you to do, right, is to schedule appointments twice a day, usually between five to 10 minutes, where you're going to go into a private space. Don't do this in a public area. You're going to feel extra weird. Okay?",13.196000000000026
552.063,564.753,SPEAKER_00," But go into a private space, typically your bedroom or your bathroom or something like that, right? Stand in front of the mirror because I want you to see yourself, okay? And out loud.",12.690000000000055
565.04,578.05,SPEAKER_00," Speak those worries, speak that anxiety, okay? And I want you to do that until that timer that you're gonna set, that five to 10 minutes goes off. And if you run out before the timer goes off, go back and start again.",13.009999999999991
578.05,592.748,SPEAKER_00," Right? And keep worrying about those things until that timer has subsided. Okay, what do you think of this idea? I'm seeing some like confusion on your face right now. Yeah, I'm trying to picture myself talking.",14.698000000000093
593.103,604.949,SPEAKER_01," to myself in front of a mirror. And honestly, it sounds pretty weird. And I feel like I might be like more vulnerable because I'm like, you know, talking to myself.",11.846000000000004
605.641,616.222,SPEAKER_00," Yeah. It's kind of weird. Yeah. Honestly, it is weird, right? And as therapists, there's oftentimes things we're recommending are a little on the odd side.",10.581000000000017
616.222,625.283,SPEAKER_00," So maybe if I explain a little bit why this works and is so effective, it'll help. So first of all,",9.061000000000035
625.283,633.502,SPEAKER_00," Like you said, it's kind of weird because it feels vulnerable, right? I'm saying all these things I don't normally say out loud. And it feels weird because I'm talking to myself.",8.218999999999937
634.008,646.242,SPEAKER_00," Well, a lot of us already talk to ourselves, right? We already have some kind of inner dialogue or we'll make little comments. I know my poor husband has discovered that as a result of my working from home more that I tend to talk out loud all day long.",12.233999999999924
646.242,660.434,SPEAKER_00," So a lot of us do this already, right? The difference is we're doing it in a structured way. And remember what I said before, anxiety is happening in some very kind of deep emotional spaces in our brain. I'm not gonna go through all the brain science because...",14.192000000000007
660.434,670.812,SPEAKER_00, I could spend all day talking about it but it's happening in a very kind of deep emotional place in our brain and when that area really gets spun up it can actually decrease,10.378000000000043
670.812,682.135,SPEAKER_00," blood flow and energy into the other parts of our brain, the wiser parts, the parts that are better at problem solving, planning, creativity, all things that we need in moments like this, right?",11.322999999999979
682.135,694.977,SPEAKER_00," And by turning, taking that stuff that's already bouncing around in our head, feels really true, might not be, very real, but not necessarily true, right? Thoughts are real, not necessarily true.",12.841999999999985
694.977,708.19,SPEAKER_00," By putting them into words, we're actively engaging other parts of our brain. We're constructing sentences. We're speaking them out loud. We're then hearing them, which is, again, engaging another part of our brain.",13.21300000000008
708.19,719.277,SPEAKER_00," And all of this allows us to kind of test what we're saying because I promise what's going to happen, one of the things that's going to occur is you're going to say something and you're going to hear yourself and you're going to go,",11.086999999999989
721.032,732.98,SPEAKER_00," Okay, that one didn't make any sense, right? Because some of what you're feeling and thinking, right, isn't necessarily rooted in things that are making sense, right? Again, very real.",11.947999999999979
732.98,742.227,SPEAKER_00," very natural, not necessarily happening right this second. Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, that does. Thank you for explaining it.",9.246999999999957
742.328,754.951,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, absolutely. So yes, I will totally acknowledge it's a very weird thing. I have learned to embrace the weird in my life. And I think that this is something that has been very helpful for a lot of my clients.",12.623000000000047
754.951,767.371,SPEAKER_00," I like to use the analogy of a brush fire, right? Anytime we have a brush fire, we don't just put water on the fire, right? The square breathing, that's water on the fire, right?",12.419999999999959
767.371,779.96,SPEAKER_00," When we have a brush fire, we like to get ahead of the fire and we like to burn off some of the fuel so that when the fire hits that area, there's nothing to burn. It's already been burned up and it helps tame the fire.",12.589000000000055
779.96,791.182,SPEAKER_00," right? This is kind of the same, right? Because now when you're going through your day and you start to worry about something, some of it's already been worried about, so it's not going to come to my mind anymore.",11.22199999999998
791.182,799.552,SPEAKER_00," There's less fuel. And when that does happen, you get to ask yourself, is this important enough that I need to",8.370000000000005
800.429,813.473,SPEAKER_00," take an extra worry appointment right now and deal with this, or can it wait until my next worry appointment? And if it can wait, write it down, right? That's a way of validating what you're feeling and thinking, right?",13.043999999999983
813.777,825.421,SPEAKER_00, And it helps you to remember to burn that fuel off the next time you have a worry appointment too. Okay. Right. Yeah. So what do you think of this idea? Can you see yourself using this?,11.644000000000005
826.636,833.74,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, I will definitely try to practice it, and hopefully it just feels more natural with time. But I'll definitely try. OK.",7.104000000000042
834.196,846.7,SPEAKER_00," Give it a couple of tries, okay? Again, it's gonna feel weird, that's okay. Again, private space, don't let anybody see you do this, okay? And let's see what happens, okay? Again, this is...",12.504000000000019
846.953,861.871,SPEAKER_00," completely different from the square breathing, right? Fire versus dealing with the fuel, right? Screwdriver, hammer, right? These are different tools. So it's not gonna be effective for every little thing, but it's gonna, again, continue to increase.",14.918000000000006
861.871,868.486,SPEAKER_00, The tools that we're currently lacking to help us manage what we're doing. Okay. Okay. Yeah.,6.615000000000009
869.245,882.712,SPEAKER_00," Good, so let's make that homework. Keep using the square breathing. We're gonna make this the homework though, okay? And why don't we find a chance to meet up again in say about two weeks to see how you're doing then, all right? That sounds good. Okay, great, let's do that.",13.466999999999985
